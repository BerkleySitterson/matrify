## Installation

1. a) Clone Repository: 'git clone https://github.com/BerkleySitterson/matrify.git' <br>
   b) Alternatively, you can download the ZIP folder by locating the dropdown menu above the repository, clicking 'Download ZIP', and extracting the folder.

2. Confirm that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (Download: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk21)<br>
    - If you are just now downloading the JDK, you must also add it to your system's environment variables
    - You can run 'java -version' to check if the JDK has been successfully set up.

3. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project is stored. The path should end in '/Matrify' or '/matrify-main'.

4. Run the following command: 'java main.Main'
